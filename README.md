Building a MERN Stack Application with AI Image Generation

Introduction:

In this project, we will build a MERN stack application that can generate images from text input using OpenAI's DALL-E deep learning model. The application will use Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js for the backend and frontend, respectively. The styling will be implemented using Tailwind, the most popular CSS framework. The generated images will be stored in Cloudinary, a cloud-based image storage service.
